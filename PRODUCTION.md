## Security Considerations

### Master Password Requirements
- Enforce minimum password length (at least 12 characters)
- Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Implement password strength metering
- Consider implementing password expiration policies

### Data Encryption
- All passwords are encrypted using AES-128 encryption before storage
- Master passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Recovery keys are hashed using SHA-256
- All communication should be encrypted with HTTPS/TLS

### Session Management
- Sessions should have appropriate timeout values
- Implement secure session storage
- Use secure and HTTP-only flags for cookies
- Regenerate session IDs after successful authentication

## Database Security

### SQLite Security
While SQLite is used in this implementation, for production consider:
- Using a more robust database system like PostgreSQL
- Implementing proper database connection pooling
- Setting up regular automated backups
- Securing database files with appropriate file permissions
- Using dedicated database users with minimal privileges

### Data Protection
- Never store plain text passwords
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly audit database access logs

### Database Maintenance
- Implement regular database vacuuming for SQLite
- Monitor database size and performance
- Set up alerts for unusual database activity

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement CSRF protection for forms

### Authentication Security
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Use secure password reset tokens with expiration
- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security
- Regularly rotate encryption keys and secrets

### API Security
- Implement proper API rate limiting
- Use authentication tokens for API access
- Validate API request payloads
- Log all API access for audit purposes

## Network Security

### HTTPS Implementation
- Always deploy with HTTPS in production
- Use strong SSL/TLS configurations
- Regularly update SSL certificates
- Implement HTTP security headers:
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection

### Firewall Configuration
- Restrict access to only necessary ports
- Implement IP whitelisting where appropriate
- Use a reverse proxy like Nginx for additional security
- Regularly update firewall rules

## Email Configuration

### Secure Email Setup
- Use app-specific passwords rather than account passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication on email accounts
- Use TLS encryption for email transmission
- Monitor email sending quotas to prevent service disruption

### Email Templates
- Customize email templates for your organization
- Include your organization's branding
- Provide clear instructions for users
- Include security awareness information

### Email Security
- Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- Monitor email delivery rates
- Set up alerts for email delivery failures
- Regularly rotate email credentials

## Environment Variables

### Critical Environment Variables
- `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server address
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port
- `SENDER_EMAIL`: Email address for sending notifications
- `SENDER_PASSWORD`: App password for the sender email
- `EMAIL_USE_TLS`: Whether to use TLS encryption
- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for session encryption

### Environment Variable Management
- Never commit environment variables to version control
- Use a secrets management system in production
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Limit access to environment variable configuration

## Deployment Strategies

### Containerization (Recommended)
Consider using Docker for consistent deployments:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:app"]
```

### Reverse Proxy Setup
Use Nginx as a reverse proxy:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

### Load Balancing
For high availability:
- Use multiple application instances
- Implement a load balancer
- Use a shared database or database cluster
- Implement health checks

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Implement application performance monitoring (APM)
- Monitor response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Track user activity for security auditing

### Log Management
- Implement centralized log management
- Log all authentication attempts
- Log all password access events
- Retain logs for compliance requirements
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activity

### Security Monitoring
- Implement intrusion detection systems
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts
- Regularly review security logs

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backup Strategy
- Implement regular automated database backups
- Store backups in secure, encrypted storage
- Test backup restoration procedures regularly
- Maintain multiple backup copies in different locations

### Disaster Recovery
- Document recovery procedures
- Regularly test disaster recovery plans
- Implement backup verification processes
- Maintain offsite backup copies

### Recovery Key Management
- Users should store recovery keys in secure locations
- Implement recovery key expiration policies
- Allow users to regenerate recovery keys
- Educate users on recovery key security

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Implement proper database indexing
- Optimize database queries
- Use connection pooling
- Monitor database performance metrics

### Caching Strategy
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement browser caching headers
- Monitor cache hit rates

### Resource Optimization
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files
- Optimize images and other media
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Use efficient algorithms for password operations

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

### Data Protection Regulations
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide data export capabilities
- Implement right to deletion procedures

### Security Audits
- Conduct regular security audits
- Perform penetration testing
- Implement vulnerability scanning
- Address security findings promptly

### Documentation
- Maintain security documentation
- Document incident response procedures
- Keep deployment documentation up to date
- Provide user security guidelines

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Updates
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Implement automated dependency updates where possible
- Test updates in staging environment first

### Patch Management
- Implement a patch management process
- Prioritize security patches
- Test patches before deployment
- Maintain rollback procedures

### Version Control
- Use version control for all application code
- Tag production releases
- Maintain a change log
- Implement code review processes
