2. **[wsgi.py](file:///Users/ashishmishra/Desktop/Building%20Projects/SecurePass%20Webapp/wsgi.py)** - WSGI entry point for Gunicorn
3. **[runtime.txt](file:///Users/ashishmishra/Desktop/Building%20Projects/SecurePass%20Webapp/runtime.txt)** - Python version specification for Render
4. **[RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](file:///Users/ashishmishra/Desktop/Building%20Projects/SecurePass%20Webapp/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Detailed Render deployment guide

## Files Modified

### requirements.txt
- Added Gunicorn dependency for production WSGI server

### app.py
- Modified secret key handling to support environment variable
- Added health check endpoint at `/health`

### README.md
- Updated Render deployment instructions with environment variable details
- Updated production mode instructions to use wsgi:application

## Configuration Details

### render.yaml
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: securepass
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:application
    envVars:
      - key: SMTP_SERVER
        sync: false
      - key: SMTP_PORT
        sync: false
      - key: SENDER_EMAIL
        sync: false
      - key: SENDER_PASSWORD
        sync: false
      - key: EMAIL_USE_TLS
        sync: false
```

### wsgi.py
```python
"""
WSGI entry point for SecurePass application.
This file is used by Gunicorn to serve the application.
"""

from app import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # For local development
    app.run()
else:
    # For production with Gunicorn
    application = app
```

### runtime.txt
```
python-3.9
```

## Deployment Process

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for a Render account at https://render.com
3. Create a new Web Service and connect it to your forked repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and configure the service
5. Add your environment variables in the Render dashboard:
   - `SMTP_SERVER`: Your SMTP server address
   - `SMTP_PORT`: Your SMTP server port
   - `SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address to send from
   - `SENDER_PASSWORD`: App password for the sender email
   - `EMAIL_USE_TLS`: Whether to use TLS (True or False)
   - `SECRET_KEY`: (Optional) Flask secret key for sessions

## Health Check Endpoint

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000000",
  "service": "SecurePass Password Manager"
}
```

## Environment Variables

All configuration is handled through environment variables, which is a Render best practice:

- Email configuration variables for password reset functionality
- Optional SECRET_KEY for Flask sessions
- Render automatically handles environment variable injection

## Testing

All Python files compile without errors:
```bash
python3 -m py_compile app.py database.py encryption_helper.py wsgi.py
```

## Conclusion

The SecurePass application is now fully configured for deployment on Render with:

1. Proper WSGI entry point for Gunicorn
2. Render-specific deployment configuration
3. Health check endpoint for monitoring
4. Environment variable-based configuration
5. Detailed deployment documentation
6. Python version specification
7. Updated dependencies

The application will automatically scale, restart if it crashes, and provide health monitoring through Render's infrastructure.
